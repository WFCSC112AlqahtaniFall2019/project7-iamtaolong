Text Description for Project 7

This project, I utilize the data from Kaggle, which is a dataset about Facebook users. url: https://www.kaggle.com/sheenabatra/facebook-data This exploratory data analysis gives insights from Facebook dataset which consists of identifying users that can be focused more to increase the business. These valuable insights should help Facebook to take intelligent decision to identify its useful users and provide correct recommendations to them.As a computer science and communication major studnet, having some researches in social media or social networking sites is obviously my interest and my strength. Figuring out how someone's age, number of friends, and even gender may have some influence on his/her/its numbers of likes received on social media like Facebook. Thus, having my project done on this topic is pretty interesting. Through building quene, stack, sortedlinkedlist, and data, I have better understanding on these topics.

PS: I dont know why there is a message popping out when I am commiting my project to Github: You are about to commit CRLF line separators to the Git repository. It is recommended to set the core.autocrlf Git attribute to input and and avoid line separator issues.
And I clicked "Fix and Commit". if there is any problem, please contact me!
