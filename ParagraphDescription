Text Description for Project 7

This project, I utilize the data from Kaggle, which is a dataset about Facebook users. url: https://www.kaggle.com/sheenabatra/facebook-data
This exploratory data analysis gives insights from Facebook dataset which consists of identifying users that can be
focused more to increase the business. These valuable insights should help Facebook to take intelligent decision to
identify its useful users and provide correct recommendations to them.

As a computer science and communication major studnet, having some researches in social media or social networking
sites is obviously my interest and my strength. Figuring out how someone's age, number of friends, and even gender
may have some influence on his/her/its numbers of likes received on social media like Facebook. Thus, having my project
done on this topic is pretty interesting.

Through building quene, stack, sortedlinkedlist, and data, I have better understanding on these topics.

Learning Objectives:
●	Write C++ programs in a modern software development using the CLion IDE and version control with Github repositories.
●	Using an existing class template, overload the less than and greater than operators.
●	Using an existing class template, overload output operator.
●	Inheriting a singly Linked List class with functions for popping at the head and printing the list, construct a Stack class that has public member functions pushing an object at the head.
●	Inheriting a singly Linked List class with functions for popping at the head and printing the list, construct a Queue class that has public member functions pushing an object at the tail.
●	Inheriting a singly Linked List with functions for popping at the head and printing the list, construct a singly Sorted Linked List class with a public member function that inserts objects into a Sorted Linked List in order as determined by the overloaded comparison operators.
